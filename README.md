# Nancy_COC_Project_Bank_Simultator
# Bank Queue Simulation Project  This my small C project made after workshop.   It shows how customers come in bank and how long they wait before geting served.  It use poisson distribution to create random arrivals and then find mean, median, mode and std deviation of waiting time.
