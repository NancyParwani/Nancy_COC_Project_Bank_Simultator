Nancy_COC_Project_Bank_Simultator
Bank Queue Simulation Project
This my small C project made after attending COC classes.   
It shows how customers come in bank and how long they wait before geting served. It uses poisson distribution to create random arrivals and then find mean, median, mode and std deviation of waiting time.
 
 Concepts Used
- loops and functions  
- struct in C  
- array and dynamic memory (malloc, realloc)  
- pointers  
- basic maths and stats (mean, median, mode, sd)

How It Works
Program ask user for average arrival rate (lambda).  
Then it run simulation for 480 minutes (8 hour bank time).  
Customers come random and teller serve one by one.  
At end program print a small report with waiting time details and manager advice.
